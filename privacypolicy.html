<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Special arbitration provision for United States or Canada users</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT CONTAINS ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE ONLY TO OUR UNITED STATES AND CANADA USERS. IF YOU ARE A Vanish Messenger USER LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES OR CANADA, IT REQUIRES YOU TO SUBMIT TO BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION OF ALL DISPUTES, EXCEPT FOR THOSE THAT INVOLVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DISPUTES AND EXCEPT THOSE THAT CAN BE BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. THIS MEANS YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE SUCH DISPUTES RESOLVED IN COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY. THIS SECTION ALSO LIMITS THE TIME YOU HAVE TO START AN ARBITRATION OR, IF PERMISSIBLE, A COURT ACTION. FINALLY, THIS SECTION WAIVES YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR DISPUTE HEARD AND RESOLVED AS A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, OR A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Excluded Dispute&rdquo; means any Dispute relating to the enforcement or infringement of your or our intellectual property rights (such as copyrights, trademarks, domains, logos, trade dress, trade secrets, and patents). For clarity and notwithstanding the foregoing, those Disputes relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity are not Excluded Disputes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Arbitration Act. The United States Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this &ldquo;Special Arbitration Provision for United States or Canada Users&rdquo; section, including any question whether a Dispute between Vanish Messenger and you is subject to arbitration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agreement to Arbitrate for Vanish Messenger Users Located in the United States or Canada.For Vanish Messenger users located in the United States or Canada, Vanish Messenger and you each agree to waive the right to a trial by judge or jury for all Disputes, except for the Excluded Disputes. Vanish Messenger and you agree that all Disputes (except for the Excluded Disputes), including those relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration. Vanish Messenger and you agree not to combine a Dispute that is subject to arbitration under our Terms with a Dispute that is not eligible for arbitration under our Terms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is started, including the Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (together, the &ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;). The arbitration will be presided over by a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA Rules. The AAA Rules, information regarding initiating a Dispute, and a description of the arbitration process are available at </span><a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adr.org%2F&amp;h=AT2V5ywJVOVETC0oKTexdq1ybIXD8aBBTC1Xk7CUhLzVA-puh1VPQu9fMi_71iwBC1gYHkbHEv0tK4tWupMNFuvweDB-yTY0g_tyov0ZClTDyexTMg8QLvN9rkFGPH-X"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.adr.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The arbitrator will decide whether a Dispute can be arbitrated. The location of the arbitration and the allocation of fees and costs for such arbitration shall be determined in accordance with the AAA Rules. Notwithstanding the AAA Rules, we will reimburse you for all the AAA administrative fees in Disputes that are subject to the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, unless the arbitrator determines that a Dispute was filed for purposes of harassment or is patently frivolous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opt-Out Procedure. You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither we nor you can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify us in writing postmarked within 30 days of the later of: (i) the date that you first accepted our Terms; and (ii) the date you became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt-out:</span></p>

As an alternative to arbitration, if permitted by your local &ldquo;small claims&rdquo; court&rsquo;s rules, you may bring your Dispute in your local &ldquo;small claims&rdquo; court, as long as the matter advances on an individual (non-class) basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time Limit to Start Arbitration. We and you agree that for any Dispute (except for the Excluded Disputes) we and you must commence an arbitration proceeding within one year after the Dispute first arose; otherwise, such Dispute is permanently barred. This means that if we or you do not commence an arbitration within one year after the Dispute first arose, then the arbitration will be dismissed because it was started too late.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Class Actions, Class Arbitrations, or Representative Actions for Users Located in the United States or Canada. We and you each agree that if you are a Vanish Messenger user located in the United States or Canada, each of we and you may bring Disputes against the other only on its or your own behalf, and not on behalf of any other person or entity, or any class of people. We and you each agree not to participate in a class action, a class-wide arbitration, Disputes brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated Disputes involving any other person or entity in connection with any Dispute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Severability. If the prohibition against class actions and other Disputes brought on behalf of third parties is found to be unenforceable for a Dispute, then all of the provisions above under the caption &ldquo;Special Arbitration Provision for United States or Canada Users&rdquo; will be null and void as to that Dispute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Place to File Permitted Court Actions. If you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, if your Dispute is an Excluded Dispute, or if the arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, you agree to be subject to the &ldquo;Forum and Venue&rdquo; provisions in the &ldquo;Dispute Resolution&rdquo; section set forth above.</span></p>
